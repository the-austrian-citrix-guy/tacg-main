## Welcome to my GitHub repository.

I want to use this repository as a way to show my enthusiasm for all kinds of Automation like Terraform, Ansible, Packer, Docker, etc.

I am working as a Principal Product Marketing Manager@Citrix/Cloud Software Group Austria GmbH in Vienna, Austria.

I have almost 30 years of experience in End-User Computing and working with Microsoft and Citrix Technologies.
As PPMM, my focus is on all kinds of Automation and HyperScalers (especially Microsoft Azure) as well as Microsoft AzureStack HCI.
I am also responsible for the Citrix TechZone in the Citrix Community together with 2 other colleagues.

I hold numerous certifications in the Microsoft and Citrix area and the Automation and Network field.
